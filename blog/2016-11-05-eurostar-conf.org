* The EuroSTAR Conference has finished
After 4 Days the Eurostar Conference 2016 has finished and it showed
up that I got to much to work up again. I will for sure go and get the
news I fetched up here. But for now I will go to get some relaxing for
the next 4 days. :) Have fun, like I will have in Stockholm.
